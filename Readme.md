# How to Run Project

## 1. Create a Virtual Environment

Use the following command to create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv myvenv
```

> **Note**: Replace `myvenv` with your desired virtual environment name. If you don't want to change it, you can keep it as `myvenv`.

- I strongly recommend using **Git Bash** to run these commands.
- Make sure you have **Python** installed properly on your system.

üì• **Git Bash Download**: [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)  
üçé For **Mac users**, you may need to install it manually.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Do **not** use my virtual environment to run this project, as it contains system-specific paths. Please create a new virtual environment on your machine.

## 2. Activate the Virtual Environment

Run the appropriate command based on your OS:

- **Windows**:
  ```bash
  source myvenv/Scripts/activate
  ```

- **Mac/Linux**:
  ```bash
  source myvenv/bin/activate
  ```
